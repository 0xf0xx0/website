    Leave it to anti-Semites and other bigots to describe the enemy as a type of people,
    to personify everything they fear as the Other. Our adversary is not a kind of human

    impossible for anyone to systematically wield coercive power over anyone else. As soon
    as that is impossible, no yacht or penthouse will sit empty long.
