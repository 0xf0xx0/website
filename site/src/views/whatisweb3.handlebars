<blockquote>
In summary, Web3 is about what you want to do, post, read, play, chat,
or interact without others saying otherwise.
<i>It is about freedom of speech and freedom of economy.</i>

<blockquote>
The basics of Web3 is the sum of all the open networks and ecosystems.
You should be able to access and visit any of these places.
You can compare this to accessing things on Google, Facebook, Apple,
or other networks/platforms that are generally walled gardens in the current web system.

To those that see Web3 as DeFi, we ask this: Do you go on your web browser to access
TradingView or other market tools as your homepage, or do you go check your social media,
email, and news sites, as well as your money?

<blockquote>
Web3 as an ideal is supposed to be about you, <code>the user</code>, not you, <code>the builder</code>.
I have seen various ideas suggesting Web3 is <code>read + write + own</code>, and I can
largely agree, though many builders don't agree with the route to achieve that.

<blockquote>
Web3 is also intended to help create a creator economy.
It's meant to support the little guy and have an open community system where
people can thrive peer to peer (P2P) and earn a living, without invasion of
privacy or de-platforming. <strong>Many will argue that it's not a real problem if you
don't do anything illegal, but that's not removing the possibility of your favorite service
disappearing over night,
it's just your decision to ignore it and eventually deal with consequences.</strong>
Web3 is meant to be here for those who don't want to accept such risks and take
the data ownership back in own hands.

<blockquote>
A new, good internet is possible, and necessary. We can build it,
with all the technological self-determination of the old, good internet,
and the ease of use of Web 2.0. A place where we can find each other, coordinate
and mobilize to resist and survive climate collapse, fascism, genocide and authoritarianism.
We can build that new, good internet. We must.
